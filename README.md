# DS-CDMA-Transmitter-and-Receiver
“This project implements a multi-user DS-CDMA Transmitter and Receiver using Verilog HDL on FPGA. Each user’s data is spread using unique PN sequences, combined into a composite signal, and recovered through despreading and correlation. The design demonstrates secure multi-access digital communication"
